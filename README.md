geiesfolds - PRE-RELEASE 0.1
==========
Crisp clear Javascript folds. This repository builds on geieslists for handling functions like cons, head/car, tail/cdr.

The intention is to convert c/q adapt in javascript the Haskell examples from 1) and 2), plus the Scala examples from 3).

All this throwing in some original experiments and links to other functional matters like tuples and continuations.

ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION
---------------------
There will be at least one post about all this at faustinelli.wordpress.com

The starting point is:
http://faustinelli.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/foldleft-foldright/
which sounds very naive (and ignorant) as of today.

DEBITS AND CREDITS
------------------
I am in deep debt with:
1) Real World Haskell, O'Reilly
2) A tutorial on the universality and expressiveness of fold (Graham Hutton)
3) http://oldfashionedsoftware.com/2009/07/30/lots-and-lots-of-foldleft-examples/

Any feedback is welcome.
